**The application has the following features:**
* Three different decision analysis mechanisms to perform what-if analysis
* A simple "expert" rules engine to predict baseball hall of fame induction, contrasted with a Machine Intelligence solution
* Single and multiple machine learning models working together to predict baseball hall of fame ballot and induction probabilities
* Machine Learning models are surfaced via ML.NET in-memory for rapid inference (predictions)
* Surfaced via the Server-Side Blazor .NET Core web application framework using SignalR to deliver the predictions from the server to the web client at scale
* Self-contained application in a Docker container on DockerHub, allowing you to run it completely offline or locally
